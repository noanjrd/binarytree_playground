# 🌳 Binary Tree Playground

An interactive **Binary Tree Visualizer** built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

This project helps you **understand binary trees visually** by constructing trees from user input and displaying their structure dynamically.

## ✨ Features

* **Multiple Construction Methods**: Build trees using **Preorder** or **Postorder** traversal with null values.
* **Binary Search Tree Support**: Validate and construct **BSTs** with automatic error detection for invalid trees.
* **Interactive Learning**: 
  - **Binary Tree Basics**: Learn the fundamentals of binary tree structures
  - **Preorder Traversal**: Step-by-step explanations with visual examples
  - **Postorder Traversal**: Detailed guides on visiting nodes in postorder
  - **BST Concepts**: Understand the rules and benefits of Binary Search Trees
* **Challenge Mode**: Test your knowledge by recreating randomly generated trees of varying depths.
* **Dynamic Visualization**: 
  - Clean node and branch rendering
  - Scales automatically with tree depth
  - Smooth fade effects for large trees
* **One-Click Examples**: Click any example code to instantly load it into the visualizer.
* **Responsive Design**: Modern UI built with **Tailwind CSS** (desktop only for now).

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Enter your tree**: Type an array like `[1,2,3,null,4,5,null]` in the input field
2. **Choose traversal order**: Select **Preorder** or **Postorder** 
3. **Optional**: Toggle BST mode to validate Binary Search Tree rules
4. **Visualize**: Your tree appears instantly on the right side!

**Tip**: Use `null` to represent empty nodes for exact tree reconstruction.
